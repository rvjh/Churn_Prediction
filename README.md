# Churn Prediction

The challenge requested to build an fully automated end-to-end Machine Learning infrastructure, including reading data from a feature store, automated model creation with hyperoptimization tuning and automatically finding the most efficient model, storing models in a model registry, building a CI/CD pipeline for deploying the registered model into a production environment, serving the model using HTTP API or Streaming interfaces, implementing monitoring, writing tests and linters, creating regular automated reporting.

Note: this is a personal project to demonstrate an automated ML infrastructure. Security was not in the scope of this project. For deploying this infrastructure in a production environment please ensure proper credentials are set for each service and the infrastructure is not exposing unwanted endpoints to the public internet.

## Final architecture:
